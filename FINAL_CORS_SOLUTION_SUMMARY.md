# 🚨 **CORS ISSUE RESOLVED - COMPLETE SOLUTION** ✅

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The OTP verification was failing due to **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violations** when the frontend tried to call Resend API directly from the browser.

### **Error Details:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.resend.com/emails' from origin 'https://learnnect.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

Created a **backend API service** that handles all Resend API calls server-side, eliminating CORS issues completely.

```

## 🔧 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP**

### **Backend (.env file):**
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_resend_api_key_here
PORT=3001
